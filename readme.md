Yomuhoudai is a full-stack web app for browsing, managing, and performing CRUD operations on a book collection. It uses Laravel for the backend API, Nuxt for the frontend, and supports both local development (via Docker) and production deployment (via Coolify on a Hetzner VPS).

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaandesu/yomuhoudai.git
```

2. Start the containers by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Install the Composer dependencies inside the Laravel container:

```bash
docker-compose exec laravel composer install
```

4. Run the database migrations:

```bash
docker-compose exec laravel php artisan migrate
```

Persistent database:

If you want to ensure that your database data persists even if the MySQL container is removed, create a file named `docker-compose.override.yml` in the project root with the following contents:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  mysql:
    volumes:
      - mysql:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  mysql:
```

Then restart the containers with:

```bash
docker-compose stop \
  && docker-compose rm -f mysql \
  && docker-compose up -d
```

---

### Environment Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file includes pre-configured environment variables under the `laravel` service:

```yaml
APP_DEBUG: "false" # Set to "true" for development mode
APP_ENV: production # Set to "local" for development environment
```

You can modify these values depending on your setup. For local development, itâ€™s recommended to use:

```yaml
APP_DEBUG: "true"
APP_ENV: local
```

---

## Frontend Development Setup

You have two options to run the frontend during development:

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose

Run the full stack including the frontend container with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d frontend
```

This uses the Dockerfile under `frontend/` which builds and serves the app via nginx on port `3000`.

---

### Option 2: Local Node Environment

1. Enter frontend folder

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

By default, the frontend connects to the deployed backend server.

To connect to your local backend instead, run:

```bash
NUXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true pnpm dev
```

This sets the frontend to send API requests to your local Laravel backend. You can change the default behaviour
through [runtimeConfig](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/runtime-config) located in nuxt.config.ts.

---

## Deployment and CI/CD Overview

The project is deployed on a VPS rented from Hetzner and managed via Coolify, which provides easy app deployment and management.

- The backend Laravel API is hosted at:  
  <https://laravel.yomuhoudai.club/>
  <https://api.yomuhoudai.club/>

- The backend staging deployment is hosted at:  
  <https://api-staging.yomuhoudai.club/>

- The frontend app is deployed and accessible at:  
  <https://app.yomuhoudai.club/>  
  <https://library.yomuhoudai.club/>

- Coolify management dashboard is available at:  
  <https://cloud.yomuhoudai.club/>

- Caddy is configured as a reverse proxy to handle routing and HTTPS certificates.

---

### GitHub Workflow for Staging Deployment

There is a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys the frontend to a staging environment on every push to the `staging` branch.

- Staging site URL:  
  <https://staging.yomuhoudai.club/>

This ensures continuous integration and deployment for testing and preview before production releases.

---

## API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI:

ðŸ”— [https://laravel.yomuhoudai.club/api/documentation](https://laravel.yomuhoudai.club/api/documentation)

This includes all available endpoints, request/response formats.
